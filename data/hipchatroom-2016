Brown line to the loop has been delayed for ~25 min now and doesn't look like it will start up again anytime soon... so, I'm going to have to be late to the 10am meeting. So so sorry!
Kyle Gilbert·Jan-4 9:35 AM
Depending on what stop you're at you can grab the 37 southbound, or the 8 southbound, bus.
Rachel Schneebaum·Jan-4 9:52 AM
Oops, closed hipchat too soon! But en route now (made it to Fullerton), so won't be as bad as I feared -- 15 min late, maybe?
Really sorry again; didn't want to kick off the new year this way :/
Boaz Reisman·Jan-4 9:53 AM
I had the same brown line issues. After waiting for 40 minutes I turned around and headed homw

Going with USB-C I think
Kris Kroski·Jan-6 9:48 AM
so you cant charge your phone and listen to music at the same time?
Kyle Gilbert·Jan-6 9:48 AM
But with bluetooth devices, and wifi syncing devices, the headphone jack only matters for your headphones that come with the phone.
And they should really introduce wireless charging with this model as well
Boaz Reisman·Jan-6 9:49 AM
Brad's got some explaining to do.

Brad Siefert·Jan-6 2:15 PM
Something cool happened. I was finally featured on Flickr’s Explore page. It’s kinda a random thing, but for all the years I’ve been on it (since 2007), it’s never happened. I’m hoping it will mean that it might happen from time to time now with some of my better images. It’s a photo that I took with my buddy Nick in Rocky Mountain. Check it out:

We have to get our electricity meter replaced(?), and of course it was rescheduled for today (when Alex is on campus being all scholarly), and of course they're going to be here during the really helpful window of "between 10:30 and 4:30"???
So what I'm trying to say is, working from home today -- unless they come at the earlier end of that window, in which case I'll be in in the afternoon
If my computer's being weird again I'll just call in to standups
