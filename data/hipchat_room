2maven/Drupal question for anybody who knows
Boaz Reisman·Jan-12 11:09 AM
shoot
Vladimir Jornitski·Jan-12 11:09 AM
The client was trying to create a new admin user, I told them to just use Drupal people->add to make the user
They said: "So do I need to create the account first like I'm signing up and then log in as "chrissy" and then assign the individual to an admin role?


I just tried signing up the individual through the link you mentioned and it didn't work (not seeing the person signed up)."
Do you think they just misunderstood how to do it or does what they said make sense? I don't see why they would have to create the account from the user side first
Boaz Reisman·Jan-12 11:13 AM
What you said sounds right. You "Should" just be able to create the new user entirely through the admin side

my housing complex gate just tried to kill me final destination-ishly
Vladimir Jornitski·Mar-3 10:28 AM
To that end, a debate rages across the Internet: Does Kanye have a God Complex? The answers to this question varies, depending on where you are on the fan-critic Kanye spectrum. But it can’t be denied that there’s a lot of venn diagram overlap between what Kanye says and does. We also know that Kanye often says things God does. The parallels are staggering, so we thought we’d pitch Kanye’s words against the Almighty himself. Can you tell the difference between the word of God and the word of Yeezus?
1. "I am the light of the world."
2. "I feed the branches of the people."
3. "I live and breathe every element in life."
4. "I am the living bread which came down from heaven."
5. "I am the way and the truth and the life."
6. "My voice travels mountains."

Hey @all - One of our investors has partnered with someone starting up one of those developer accelerator programs in Chicago, but trying to focus on not teaching random n00bs to code, but more about taking more experienced developers and honing certain skillsets.  I don't know a ton about it, but theyre having a kick-off event Thursday evening at 1871 and he has invited us to attend.  I am planning on going for a little bit.  If anyone else would like to go, here is the link with more info: https://www.codefellows.org/events

There was a stand at the farmers market selling eggs and I thought hmm might as well get a dozen. I ended up retreating in confusion from the sheer number of options
There were like five indistinguishable (to the eye) varieties
All at different price points
With a variety of buzzwords
Some lady was talking shop with the proprietors about how she wanted 15 dozen (!!!!) Of one kind and then one dozen of another kind that was (she said with a chuckle) ONLY fit for husbands, NOT brownies

From Michael Noonan:

"Hello Henry!

Hope all is well with you - and Birdfeud/Earlybird! Things are great with me - no major complaints to make. I know it is very last minute - but I wanted to invite you to a reception at the Olympia Centre (aka Neiman Marcus Building) this evening from 5:30-7:30pm. The building purchased 5 of my photographs (9 pieces in total), and they are displaying them in the lobby off of Chicago Ave for 3+ months before they get folded into their corporate collection and dispersed throughout the city. The installation happened on January 28th and it is going to be up through May 5th. The building has graciously offered to host a cocktail reception for me, and I would love it if you could come!! I know it is very last minute - but I just realized that you and your team's work on my website has been pretty instrumental in moving my work into the public eye. The building spent a lot of time on my website before they contacted me - and ultimately purchased the pieces. And feel free to bring friends/guests - the more, the merrier! It should be a nice way to start a fun evening!"

@all: After much deliberation, @Boaz and I have decided that we need to go back to using Drupal. Though there were a few bumps in the road earlier, we didn't give it a fair chance. Drupal will allow us to work faster and our applications will be much safer. Collab Lyfe will the first *new* Drupal project. We thank you for your patience during this transition.

goodbye cruel world.
Vladimir Jornitski·Apr-6 10:16 PM
alright
finally some needed clarification
furious7 is indeed meant to be called "furious seven." it is, as you might imagine, a reference to its direct artistic forbear, The Seven Samurai
on the other hand, "fast & furious 6" (what the IDIOT marketing department called it) was ACTUALLY meant to be called "furious 6"
with numeral intact
Kris Kroski·Apr-6 10:17 PM
why not 6fast 6furious?
Vladimir Jornitski·Apr-6 10:17 PM
they missed that boat when they didnt call the fourth one "4 speed, 4 fury"
which i was really hoping they would
Boaz Reisman·Apr-6 10:18 PM
why not, "slightly slower and calmer"
Vladimir Jornitski·Apr-6 10:18 PM
the titles of the series are, in order, "the fast and the furious," "2 fast 2 furious," "the fast and the furious: tokyo drift" (which, until the most recent one, was the last film in the series CHRONOLOGICALLY in the fast & furious timeline, only now superseded by furious seven), "fast & furious," "fast five," "furious6," and "furious seven"
it's still the best titled series in cinematic history i think
Kris Kroski·Apr-6 10:19 PM
furious6 looks like a spammy domain
Vladimir Jornitski·Apr-6 10:19 PM
theres so much to appreciate. as a juvenile i thought "2 fast 2 furious" was the greatest achievement in movie naming history, but as i get older im beginning to appreciate "fast & furious" more
they named a sequel by removing 2 definite articles
i mean... what the hell did they do in the russian market?

Last night Im the first one to show up to this event, so I sit there eating chips and salsa until someone else shows up.  The first guy gets there and comes sits near me and says "Earlybird gets the chips I guess huh?" I give him a courtesy chuckle and try to figure out how he knows who I am.
Of course, he doesnt, and know idea our company was called Earlybird and was just making a really bad joke
But this did not hit me until like 30 min later

Can we create a brand new AWS account for the new internal dev server, and move the other servers gradually?  I would prefer to get away from using Andrew Weber's account, and all of the custom configuration.  That, or we go in and change all of the account settings so that it doesn't point to his old apartment or his old security questions.

In later seasons, stories are introduced by his cat (in puppet form for some reason), who apparently can talk, but only in puppet form. In the story that the cat has introduced, the not-grandmother is still narrating, and the cat is now Caillou’s not-special, not-talking, not-puppet cat. I don’t get it at all.
