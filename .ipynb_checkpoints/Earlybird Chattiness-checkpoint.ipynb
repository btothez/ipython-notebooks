The building purchased 5 of my photographs (9 pieces in total), and they are displaying them in the lobby off of Chicago Ave for 3+ months before they get folded into their corporate collection and dispersed throughout the city. The installation happened on January 28th and it is going to be up through May 5th. The building has graciously offered to host a cocktail reception for me, and I would love it if you could come!! I know it is very last minute - but I just realized that you and your team's work on my website has been pretty instrumental in moving my work into the public eye. The building spent a lot of time on my website before they contacted me - and ultimately purchased the pieces. And feel free to bring friends/guests - the more, the merrier!
